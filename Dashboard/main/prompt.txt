hi there. i am working on an employee tracking system for an institusion called mbarara university of sciecne and technology. it's supposed to track employees basing on different metrics/criteria. these include academic performance, wehre we see hwo many phd's, masters, first class degrees and second class degrees. we also track publications, these can include book chapters, books with isbn, coauthor and first author publications. then we see grants, won, supervision of postgraduate students, ie masters and phd, community services done, innovations won which cna be patent, products, copyright trade marks etc. 
so i need to design a university dashboard which will show how the university has performed to the human resource manager. this should haave three sections. 
academic performance, this should show hwo the university is performing academically. you should see which of the metrics should be in this section. then the second section is research and publications. where we see how the university is performing in research and innovations. then the last section is community service. these should have headings, academic performance, then the inforamtion, research and innnovations, then visualizations. then community service and its visualizatins. 
you should put visualizations which are explainable. 
use bootstrap, and nice styling to make the design look very good
